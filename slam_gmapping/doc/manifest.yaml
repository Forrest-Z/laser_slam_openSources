description: "This package contains a ROS wrapper for OpenSlam's Gmapping. \n  The\
  \ gmapping package provides laser-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping),\
  \ \n  as a ROS node called slam_gmapping. Using slam_gmapping, you can create a\
  \ 2-D occupancy\n  grid map (like a building floorplan) from laser and pose data\
  \ collected by a mobile robot."
